# forecast-drb

Pipeline and code for downloading and creating an updated visualization to accompany the Delaware River Basin (DRB) forecasting model outputs in 2022.

## How to build

This repo contains a lightweight `targets` pipeline to load data from the forecast outputs (manually downloaded from [here](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/wp/forecast-preprint-code/-/tree/main/in) for now) and then create output visuals. To run the full pipeline, install all necessary packages and then run `targets::tar_make()`.
